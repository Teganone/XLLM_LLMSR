We can also deduce that if factory A participates, then factory B must participate (since factory B cannot participate without factory A participating).",

    "question": "Thinking: refers to the indirect generalized reflection of objective things by the human brain.Thinking can be divided into (1) action thinking according to the difference of things or thinking states in the thinking process, which refers to the thinking supported by actual actions in the thinking process.Its characteristics are that the task is intuitive, given in a specific form, and the solution is actual action; (2) Image thinking refers to the process of analysis, synthesis, abstraction, and generalization with appearance.The feature is the use of vivid Objective image; (3) Abstract thinking refers to the process of reflecting the laws of movement of objective things by means of concepts, judgments, reasoning and other forms, and understanding the essential characteristics and internal connections of things.\nWhich of the following fits the definition of action thinking? ?\nA.Holmes found that the killer must have exited from the chimney on the roof by finding no other exit in the house, although the chimney was small\nB.Hong Xiguan's son was asked to watch his father practice martial arts every day when he was very young.Gradually, he was able to compare with his father\nProfessor C.Liu likes to illustrate the problem by citing a large number of examples in his article\nD.Architectural students sometimes need to make a model based on architectural drawings when designing architectural plans.This seems to be more helpful in finding defects in architectural design.",
