# Declarations
options = EnumSort([A, B, C, D])
fair_use = Function([options] -> [bool])

# Constraints
fair_use(A) == False ::: (1) Option A involves singing an unpublished song, which is not a specified case of fair use
fair_use(B) == True ::: (2) Option B translates an English work into Mongolian and publishes it, fitting fair use
fair_use(C) == True ::: (3) Option C copies artistic works displayed in public places, fitting fair use
fair_use(D) == True ::: (4) Option D copies a published paper for reference, fitting fair use

# Verifications
is_deduced(True, And(fair_use(B) == True, fair_use(D) == True)) ::: (1) Options B and D seem to fit into the category of fair use, as they involve translating and using published works for non-commercial purposes
is_deduced(True, fair_use(C) == True) ::: (2) Option C involves copying artistic works displayed in public places, which is also a specified case of fair use
is_deduced(True, fair_use(A) == False) ::: (3) Option A, however, involves singing an unpublished song, which is not a specified case of fair use
