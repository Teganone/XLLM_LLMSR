# Declarations
options = EnumSort([A, B, C, D])

fair_use(C) == True ::: (C copies artistic works displayed in outdoor public places, fitting fair use)
fair_use(D) == True ::: (D copies a published paper for reference, fitting fair use)

# Verifications

is_deduced(fair_use(C) == True, True) ::: (2) Option C involves copying artistic works displayed in public places
is_deduced(fair_use(A) == False, True) ::: (3) Option A involves singing an unpublished song
