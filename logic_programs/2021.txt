# Declarations
options = EnumSort([A, B, C, D])
fair_use = Function([options] -> [bool])

# Constraints
fair_use(A) == False ::: Option A involves an unpublished work and is not a fair use case
fair_use(B) == True ::: Option B involves translating and publishing a work, which qualifies as fair use
fair_use(C) == True ::: Option C involves copying artistic works displayed in public places, which qualifies as fair use
fair_use(D) == True ::: Option D involves copying a published work for reference, which qualifies as fair use

# Verifications
is_deduced(And(fair_use(B) == True, fair_use(D) == True), True) ::: (1) Options B and D fit the fair use category
is_deduced(fair_use(C) == True, True) ::: (2) Option C fits the fair use category
is_deduced(fair_use(A) == True, False) ::: (3) Option A does not fit the fair use category
