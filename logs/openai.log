Make sure the fixed program follows these rules:\n                    1. Use Python syntax instead of mathematical symbols (use \'and\' instead of \'∧\', \'or\' instead of \'∨\', \'not\' instead of \'¬\')\n                    2. Ensure all variables are defined\n                    3. Don\'t use comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=) on enumeration types unless the function returns an integer type\n                    4. Use == for equality comparison, not Equals function\n                    5. Ensure all custom functions are defined in the declarations section\n\n                    Original problem:\n                    Given a question and a cot_parsing. The task is to formulate the problem as a logic program(All the self-defined syntax could be seen in the following examples), consisting three parts: Declarations, Constraints, and Verification. Please strictly follow the samples below to generate the result, do not gennerate any other irrelevant contents. \nDeclarations: Declare the variables and functions from the question.\nConstraints: Write the constraints or conditions in the question as logic formulas.\nVerifications: Write the verification of statement and evidence in the cot_parsing as logic formulas.\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n1. When using boolean values, always use capitalized True and False, not lowercase true and false. For example, use "is_playing(m) == True" instead of "is_playing(m) == true".\n2. Ensure that all variable names used in Constraints and Verifications are declared in the Declarations section.\n3. Make sure all names in the Declarations section are consistent with those used in the Constraints and Verifications sections.\n4. Do not add any irrelevant comments, such as comments starting with // or #, except # Declarations, # Constraints, # Verifications.\n5. Ensure that variable names used in different EnumSort declarations are unique and do not overlap. For example, instead of:\n   people = EnumSort([A, B, C])\n   seats = EnumSort([A, B, D])\n   \n   Use distinct names to avoid ambiguity:\n   people = EnumSort([PersonA, PersonB, PersonC])\n   seats = EnumSort([SeatA, SeatB, SeatD])\n6. All parts of the logic program (Declarations, Constraints, and Verifications) must be expressed using formal logical expressions, not natural language or strings. For example:\n   INCORRECT (using strings or natural language):\n   is_deduced(is_good_cause_law(C) == True, "It states that if it rains, then the ground will be wet")\n   Implies(position_of(Y) < position_of(M), "Q is earlier than K and X")\n   \n   CORRECT (using logical expressions):\n   is_deduced(is_good_cause_law(C) == True, Implies(rains == True, ground_wet == True))\n   Implies(position_of(Y) < position_of(M), And(position_of(Q) < position_of(K), position_of(Q) < position_of(X)))\n7. Only use logic expressions or syntax patterns that appear in the examples. Do not create your own syntax.\n8. When using positions or any values that require arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, comparison), use [int] instead of EnumSort. EnumSort values CANNOT be compared with operators like <, >, <=, >=.\n9. Ensure all variables are defined as EnumSort or [int] or [bool].\n\n------\nquestion:\nThere are 7 outstanding students G, H, L, M, U, W and Z in a school.
